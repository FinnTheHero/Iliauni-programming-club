## Iliauni Programming Club

This is a club for Iliauni students.

As you may know, not everyone is tech-savvy, especially newcomers who need to adapt quickly to fast-paced environments like those in `Computer Science` or `Computer Engineering`.

That's why this club is focused on the technical side, which may not be covered elsewhere. Our goal and aim are to spread tech literacy.

### Additional Topics

1. **Coding Workshops**: Regular workshops to improve coding skills in various languages.
2. **Tech Talks**: Inviting guest speakers to discuss the latest trends and technologies in the industry.
3. **Hackathons**: Organizing hackathons for members to work on innovative projects and solve real-world problems.
4. **Open Source Contributions**: Encouraging members to contribute to open-source projects and providing guidance on how to get started.
5. **Networking Events**: Hosting networking events to connect members with professionals in the tech industry and potential employers.
